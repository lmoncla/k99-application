    "# Scrape PMIDs from Genbank entries\n",

    "June 22, 2018 \n",
    "\n",
    "I think that one of the challenges of doing the H5N1 project that I'm proposing is that in the databases (both IRD and GISAID) generally there is not any annotation of which sequences come from wild vs. domestic birds. This is primarily an issue for ducks and geese, which are widely farmed but also are wild. It seems like the only way to actually get this information is to follow the genbank links and use them to get the pubmed IDs, and then read the paper. When you do this, it is often pretty obvious which samples are wild vs. domestic. However, this would reqiure manually annotating thousands of sequences. In order to get a grasp on how difficult this would be, I would like to take an input of entries with genbank numbers, follow those links to get the pubmed ID, and then make a list of unique pubmed IDs. That would give me a better sense for how many papers would actually need to be read. I am currently using a list from GISAID including all H5N1 sequences from duck, geese, or \"other avian\" species. "

      "BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype \n",
      "are widely distributed within poultry populations in Egypt and have caused\n",
      "multiple human infections. Linking the epidemiological and sequence data is\n",
      "important to understand the transmission, persistence and evolution of the virus.\n",
      "This work describes the phylogenetic dynamics of H5N1 based on molecular\n",
      "characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of isolates collected from\n",
      "February 2006 to May 2014.\n",
      "METHODS: Full-length HA sequences of 368 H5N1 viruses were generated and were\n",
      "genetically analysed to study their genetic evolution. They were collected from\n",
      "different poultry species, production sectors, and geographic locations in Egypt.\n",
      "The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method was applied to estimate the \n",
      "evolutionary rates among different virus clusters; additionally, an analysis of\n",
      "selection pressures in the HA gene was performed using the Single Likelihood\n",
      "Ancestor Counting (SLAC) method.\n",
      "RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis of the H5 gene from 2006-14 indicated the\n",
      "presence of one virus introduction of the classic clade (2.2.1) from which two\n",
      "main subgroups were originated, the variant subgroup which was further subdivided\n",
      "into 2 sub-divisions (2.2.1.1 and 2.2.1.1a) and the endemic subgroup (2.2.1.2).\n",
      "The clade 2.2.1.2 showed a high evolution rate over a period of 6 years (6.9 ×\n",
      "10(-3) sub/site/year) in comparison to the 2.2.1.1a variant cluster (7.2 × 10(-3)\n",
      "over a period of 4 years). Those two clusters are under positive selection as\n",
      "they possess 5 distinct positively selected sites in the HA gene. The mutations\n",
      "at 120, 154, and 162 HA antigenic sites and the other two mutations (129∆, I151T)\n",
      "that occurred from 2009-14 were found to be stable in the 2.2.1.2 clade.\n",
      "Additionally, 13 groups of H5N1 HPAI viruses were identified based on their amino\n",
